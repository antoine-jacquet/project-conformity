`evolution_conformity.md` is a text file explaining briefly the mechanics of the model.


## Folder `evolution_conformity`

The MATLAB code for the graphs of Figures 4 and 5.  
The main code is in the file `evolution_conformity.m`. It produces the evolutionary dynamics graphs for Figure 5 for different parameter values.  
Simulations results are stored in the file `results_simulations.mat`.  
The file `heatmap.m` uses these results to produce the success rates graph of Figure 4.


## Folder `sigmoid_graphs`
The R code for the sigmoid curve plots in Figure 1.
