`evolutionConformity.md` is a text file explaining briefly the mechanics of the model.

Folder `Fig1`: the R code for the sigmoid curve plots in Figure 1.

Folder `Fig5`: the MATLAB code for the evolutionary dynamics graphs in Figure 5.  
The main code for the simulations is in the file `evolutionConformity.m`.

Folder `Fig4`: the MATLAB code for the successful invasion of conformity graphs in Figure 4.  
The main code is in the file `evolutionConformity.m`, which basically embeds the previous code of `evolutionConformity.m` for Figure 5 in a loop over several parameter values.  
The file `ConformitySimulations.mat` stores the success rates of previous computations.
