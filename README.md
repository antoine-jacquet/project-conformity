`evolutionConformity.md` is a text file explaining briefly the mechanics of the model.

File `Fig1': the R code which was used to make the sigmoid curve graphs in Figure 1.

File `Fig5': the MATLAB code which was used to make the sigmoid curve graphs in Figure 1.

File `Fig6': the MATLAB code which was used to make the sigmoid curve graphs in Figure 1.





The code, written in MATLAB, is in the folder `code`. The main file with the simulation is `evolutionConformity.m`. The other files, `randp.m` and `seed.mat`, are necessary to run `evolutionConformity.m` correctly.
