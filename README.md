# Evolution of conformity
 
Code for simulations on the evolution of conformity for the paper *Conformity in mate choice, the overlooked social component of animal and human culture* by Sabine NÃ¶bel, Antoine Jacquet, Guillaume Isabel, Arnaud Pocheville, Paul Seabright, & Etienne Danchin.

`evolutionConformity.md` is a text file explaining the mechanics of the model.

The code, written in MATLAB, is in the folder `code`. The main file with the simulation is `evolutionConformity.m`. The other files, `randp.m` and `seed.mat`, are necessary to run `evolutionConformity.m` correctly.
